## SEND NOW (with the 1-pager):

```
Here's the 1-pager! 📄

Quick summary:
✅ Bot is ready and tested
✅ Server running in Amsterdam (low latency)
✅ Email wallet confirmed - we're good there

To get started, I just need:
1. API credentials from Polymarket (Settings → Builder → Create Key)
2. Wallet private key (let's do this via Signal for security)

The doc explains everything - what the bot does, what it won't do, the testing phases, and safety measures.

Let me know if any questions! Happy to hop on a quick call too.
```

## IF THEY ASK HOW TO GET API KEYS:

```
Super easy:

1. Go to polymarket.com
2. Click your profile icon → Settings
3. Click "Builder Codes" tab
4. Click "Create New"
5. You'll see: API Key, Secret, and Passphrase

Screenshot those 3 values and send them over (these are safe to share - they can't withdraw funds, only trade)
```

---

## IF THEY ASK ABOUT THE PRIVATE KEY:

```
For the private key, here's how to get it from MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask extension
2. Click the 3 dots next to your account name
3. Click "Account Details"
4. Click "Export Private Key"
5. Enter your MetaMask password
6. Copy the key (starts with 0x...)

⚠️ Send this via Signal only, not regular text. It's the most sensitive piece - gives full wallet access.

Once I have it, I'll configure it directly on the server (never stored on my computer).
```

---

## IF THEY ASK ABOUT TESTING BUDGET:

```
For testing I'd suggest $20-50 in USDC on Polygon.

The bot starts with $1 trades, so even $20 gives us 20 test trades to validate everything works.

Once we're confident, we can discuss scaling to the 0.5-1% you mentioned.
```

---

## IF THEY ASK WHEN WE CAN START:

```
As soon as I have the credentials, I can:
- Tonight: Configure everything
- Tomorrow 9am ET: Run first dry tests (simulated)
- Tomorrow afternoon: Share results
- If all good: Start $1 real trades

15-min markets run 9am-11pm ET, so that's our trading window.
```

---

## FOLLOW-UP (after they send credentials):

```
Got everything, thanks! 🙌

Setting it up now. I'll run a dry test tonight/tomorrow morning and send you the results before we do anything with real money.

You'll be able to see exactly what the bot would have traded and at what prices.
```
